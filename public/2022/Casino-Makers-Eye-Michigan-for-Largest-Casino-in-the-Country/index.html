        <h1 id="Casino-Makers-Eye-Michigan-for-Largest-Casino-in-the-Country"><a href="#Casino-Makers-Eye-Michigan-for-Largest-Casino-in-the-Country" class="headerlink" title="Casino Makers Eye Michigan for Largest Casino in the Country"></a>Casino Makers Eye Michigan for Largest Casino in the Country</h1><p>In the wake of legalized gambling in Michigan, casino developers are eyeing the state as a potential site for the largest casino in the country.</p>
<p>Indian tribes and commercial casino operators are bidding for licenses to build casinos in three areas of Michigan – Detroit, Lansing and Grand Rapids. The proposals include plans for world-class gaming and entertainment complexes that would dwarf any existing casino in the United States.</p>
<p>The interest in developing casinos in Michigan comes as no surprise. The state has a population of over 10 million people, making it the ninth-largest in the country. And with lawmakers voting to legalize gambling last year, there is now a potential market of more than 3 million people who can legally gamble at casinos.</p>
<p>Casino developers believe that the Michigan market can support several large casinos, each generating hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue. MGM Resorts International, which is bidding on a license to build a casino in Detroit, projects that its facility will generate over $500 million per year in gross gaming revenue.</p>
<p>While some residents oppose expanded gambling, surveys show that most Michiganders are in favor of it. In a 2017 poll by Marketing Resource Group, 63 percent of respondents said they supported legalizing full-scale casinos in Michigan. And with good jobs and tax revenue at stake, it’s likely that many more voters will come around to support gambling as more details about these large new casinos come to light.</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-Could-Be-Home-to-Largest-Casino-in-Michigan"><a href="#Detroit-Could-Be-Home-to-Largest-Casino-in-Michigan" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Could Be Home to Largest Casino in Michigan"></a>Detroit Could Be Home to Largest Casino in Michigan</h1><p>The city of Detroit is considering a proposal to build the largest casino in the state at the site of the former Joe Louis Arena.</p>
<p>The $1.2 billion complex would include a hotel, spa, and theater in addition to the casino. It would be operated by MGM Resorts International, which already operates casinos in Detroit and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>If approved, construction on the new casino would begin in 2020 and it would open in 2022.</p>
<p>Supporters say that the new casino would create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the city. They argue that it would be an important attraction for tourists and that it would help revive Detroit’s struggling economy.</p>
<p>Opponents say that the city doesn’t need another casino and that it would cannibalize business from existing casinos. They also argue that it would lead to increased crime and social problems.</p>
<p>The proposed casino has generated a lot of controversy and is sure to face a lot of opposition at the City Council level.</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-Casino-Developer-Eyes-Largest-casino-in-Michigan"><a href="#Detroit-Casino-Developer-Eyes-Largest-casino-in-Michigan" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Casino Developer Eyes Largest casino in Michigan"></a>Detroit Casino Developer Eyes Largest casino in Michigan</h1><p>A Detroit developer is eyeing a large casino development in Michigan. The proposed casino would be the largest in the state, and would be built in partnership with MGM Resorts International.</p>
<p>The proposed casino would be located on the Detroit River, just south of downtown Detroit. It would include a hotel, restaurants, and other amenities. The project would cost an estimated $1 billion to build, and would create thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts is no stranger to large-scale casino developments. The company is currently building a $1.3 billion casino resort in National Harbor, Maryland. That project is expected to open late next year.</p>
<p>If the Detroit casino project moves forward, it could face some competition from Caesars Windsor Casino in Canada. That casino is just across the river from Detroit, and has been a major draw for gamblers in Michigan.</p>
<p>The developer behind the Detroit casino project is businessman Dan Gilbert. Gilbert is the founder of Quicken Loans and the majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team. He has been involved in several major development projects in Detroit in recent years, including a new sports arena for the Cavs.</p>
<p>The proposed Detroit casino has already faced some opposition from local residents and businesses. Some people are concerned about the potential for crime and traffic congestion that a large casino would bring to the area.</p>

The proposed casino would be 320,000 square feet and include 2,500 slot machines, 150 table games, and a 35-table poker room.</p>
<p>The casino would also have a 1,500-space parking garage and a 100,000-square-foot entertainment venue. The $275 million project would create 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The company is asking the state for permission to build the casino in Detroit’s downtown gaming district. If approved, the casino would be built on the site of the former Joe Louis Arena.</p>
<p>“We are excited about this opportunity to develop a world-class destination resort in Detroit that will create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in new economic activity for the city and state,” said Motor City Gaming CEO Dan Gilbert.</p>
<p>Detroit mayor Mike Duggan expressed his support for the proposal. “This is an important project for Detroit that will create jobs and stimulate economic development downtown,” he said.</p>
<p>If approved, Motor City Gaming would join three other casinos in Detroit’s downtown gaming district: MGM Grand Detroit, Greektown Casino-Hotel, and Jack Entertainment Complex (formerly Caesars Windsor).</p>
