<h1 id="How-will-Harmony-Air-Lines-improve-the-passenger’s-flying-experience"><a href="#How-will-Harmony-Air-Lines-improve-the-passenger’s-flying-experience" class="headerlink" title="How will Harmony Air Lines improve the passenger’s flying experience?"></a>How will Harmony Air Lines improve the passenger’s flying experience?</h1><p>The airline has been operational for over two years, and formed in early 2015 as a subsidiary of Hainan Airlines Group. The airline plans to commence services in 2019, with the Airbus A350-900 aircraft, followed by an order for 20 Boeing 787-9s.</p>
<p>Harmony Air Lines plans to change the flying experience for passengers with its new business model. The airline will have a lower cost base than other airlines by reducing the number of staff, using a single aircraft type and streamlining ground operations. This will enable Harmony to offer more competitive fares and improve the passenger experience. In addition, the airline plans to offer a unique product which will be differentiated from other airlines. By providing an excellent product at a low cost, Harmony Air Lines is confident that it will be successful in the highly competitive aviation market.</p>
<p>The airline plans to commence services in 2019, with the Airbus A350-900 aircraft, followed by an order for 20 Boeing 787-9s. The A350-900 is an incredibly advanced aircraft which offers many features that will improve the passenger’s flying experience. For example, the cabin is pressurized to 6,000 feet (1,829 meters), which is lower than most other aircraft and allows passengers to feel more refreshed when they disembark. The aircraft also has large overhead bins which can accommodate up to eight standard size suitcases. This will reduce the need to check bags into the cargo hold and enable passengers to take more items on board with them.</p>
<p>The Boeing 787-9 is also an excellent choice of aircraft for Harmony Air Lines. It is fuel efficient and has a longer range than other aircraft in its class, which means that it can fly further distances without having to refuel. This will be important for the airline as it expands its network across Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>Harmony Air Lines plans to offer a unique product which will be differentiated from other airlines. By providing an excellent product at a low cost, Harmony Air Lines is confident that it will be successful in the highly competitive aviation market. One way that the airline plans to differentiate itself is by offering complimentary food and drinks onboard its flights. Passengers will be able to enjoy a wide selection of both hot and cold meals, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. In addition, all passengers will be given a complimentary bag of inflight entertainment including movies, TV shows, games and music. This will ensure that passengers have a enjoyable experience during their flight with Harmony Air Lines.</p>
