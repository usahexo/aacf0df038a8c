But what if there was a way to reduce the stress of flying? Harmony Air Lines is looking to do just that with a new cabin redesign that will make flying less stressful.\n\nThe key to Harmony's new cabin design is its focus on privacy and relaxation. The seats are spaced further apart for more privacy, and the cabin is decorated in muted colors and soft textures to create a calm and relaxing environment. Passengers will also have access to yoga mats and other relaxation aids, such as noise-cancelling headphones, to help them relax during their flight.\n\nIn addition to the redesigned cabin, Harmony Air Lines will also be introducing a new menu designed to promote healthy eating and relaxation. The menu features dishes like salmon with rice and vegetables, which are both healthy and easy to digest. Beverages like herbal tea and water will also be available to help passengers relax and stay hydrated.\n\nBy introducing a new cabin design that focuses on privacy and relaxation, Harmony Air Lines hopes to make flying less stressful for passengers.

The airline plans to commence services in 2019, with the Airbus A350-900 aircraft, followed by an order for 20 Boeing 787-9s.\n\nHarmony Air Lines plans to change the flying experience for passengers with its new business model. The airline will have a lower cost base than other airlines by reducing the number of staff, using a single aircraft type and streamlining ground operations. This will enable Harmony to offer more competitive fares and improve the passenger experience. In addition, the airline plans to offer a unique product which will be differentiated from other airlines. By providing an excellent product at a low cost, Harmony Air Lines is confident that it will be successful in the highly competitive aviation market.\n\nThe airline plans to commence services in 2019, with the Airbus A350-900 aircraft, followed by an order for 20 Boeing 787-9s. The A350-900 is an incredibly advanced aircraft which offers many features that will improve the passenger's flying experience. For example, the cabin is pressurized to 6,000 feet (1,829 meters), which is lower than most other aircraft and allows passengers to feel more refreshed when they disembark. The aircraft also has large overhead bins which can accommodate up to eight standard size suitcases. This will reduce the need to check bags into the cargo hold and enable passengers to take more items on board with them.\n\nThe Boeing 787-9 is also an excellent choice of aircraft for Harmony Air Lines.
