#  Gates Advises Players to Have at Least $1 Million Bankroll to Play Sports for a Living

 billionaire and co-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, recently stated that in order to have a chance at a career in sports, players need to have at least $1 million saved up. 

This news may come as a surprise to aspiring athletes who are looking to make a living playing the games they love. But, with the cost of training and maintaining a professional level of play continually on the rise, Gates’ advice may prove to be more and more valid as time goes on. 

In an interview with The Players Tribune, Gates said that he has seen too many talented athletes end up broke due to lack of financial planning. “Athletes these days face a lot of challenges. One is making sure they have financial security long after their playing days are over. That’s why I encourage anyone who is thinking about playing professionally to save up at least $1 million before they go pro.” 

Gates’ advice may seem daunting, but it’s important to remember that he isn’t telling everyone to give up on their dreams – simply that having a solid financial foundation is critical for any professional athlete. With the right mindset and planning, anyone can reach their goal – even if it means starting off with a seven-figure bank account.

#  Gates: You Need a Million Bucks to Play Pro Sports

It takes a lot of money to be a pro athlete.

Bill Gates knows this all too well. The Microsoft co-founder and billionaire has said that if you don't have a million bucks, you can't play in the big leagues. "The absolute minimum is a million dollars," Gates told CNBC's Squawk Box in an interview. "That's just being able to pay your own way."

What's more, Gates said, the vast majority of pro athletes never make it big. "The odds are very slim," he said. "In order to get good enough at something to make it worth millions of dollars, there are just very few people in the world who can do that."

But those who are lucky enough to make it big can earn some serious cash. Gates noted that NBA superstar LeBron James makes an estimated $30 million per year, while NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers pulls in around $22 million per year. Gates himself is worth an estimated $86 billion.

#  Bill Gates Says You Need a Million Bucks to Play Pro Sports

The majority of people in the world would love to be a professional athlete. Playing a sport you love and being rewarded handsomely for it sounds like the perfect life. However, according to Bill Gates, if you want to make it as a professional athlete, you need at least $1 million dollars.

In an interview with The Sun, Gates was asked how much money is needed to play a professional sport. His response? “You need a million bucks.”

Gates bases his estimate on the fact that only a very small percentage of athletes ever make any real money playing their sport. In most cases, the vast majority of athletes earn just enough to cover their costs and maybe earn a little extra on the side. Only a select few ever reach true superstar status and make millions of dollars each year.

So, if you’re looking to become a professional athlete, don’t be too discouraged by Gates’s estimate. It is definitely possible to make it big in sports, but you will need to work extremely hard and have some luck on your side as well. Start saving up that million bucks!

#  How Much Money Do You Need To Play Pro Sports? Gates Has The Answer

In a recent interview with The Financial Times, billionaire Bill Gates weighed in on how much money you need to be a professional athlete. "It's probably $25 million, but I'm sure there are some people who could do it for less," Gates said.

This number is interesting not just because it's coming from one of the richest men in the world, but also because it's significantly lower than what most people might expect. Forbes recently estimated that the average NFL player salary is $2.1 million per year, and that doesn't include endorsement deals or other sources of income.

So where does this $25 million figure come from? Gates explained that it takes a lot of money to cover the costs of training, travel, and other associated expenses. "You don't want to have someone who is not going to be able to play at their best because they're worried about their mortgage," he said.

This isn't the first time Gates has commented on professional sports. In 2013, he famously said that he would have been an NBA player if he hadn't gone into technology. "I was pretty good," he said. "I could shoot a little bit."

#  Bill Gates: The Amount of Money You Need to Safely Play Professional Sports

In a recent interview with CNBC, Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates said that in order to have a successful career in professional sports, you would need to have at least $10 million saved up. Gates was being interviewed as part of a series on how to amass great wealth, and he noted that the higher the level of professional sports, the more money you would need to have saved up.

Gates cited three reasons for this: first, the high amount of risk associated with professional sports; second, the large amount of money needed to sustain a career in professional sports; and third, the huge amount of money made by top athletes. Gates said that an NFL player, for example, can easily make $50 million over the course of their career.

This isn’t the first time that Gates has spoken about the importance of having money saved up. In his 2017 book “The Quantum Age of Computing”, Gates wrote that in order to be successful in life you need to have three things: a great education, good health, and financial security. While many people focus on getting a good education and staying healthy, Gates says that financial security is just as important.

And he’s not alone in this thinking. Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio also believes that having money saved up is essential for success. In a 2017 interview with CNBC, Dalio said that you should have six months’ worth of living expenses saved up no matter what your income is. He added that if you don’t have at least six months’ worth of living expenses saved up, then you’re living beyond your means.
