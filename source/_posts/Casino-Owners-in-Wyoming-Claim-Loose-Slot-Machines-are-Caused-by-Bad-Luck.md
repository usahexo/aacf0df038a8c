#  Casino Owners in Wyoming Claim Loose Slot Machines are Caused by Bad Luck

Casino-goers in Wyoming are up in arms after several casino owners claimed that the loose slot machines at their establishments are caused by nothing more than bad luck.
In a recent statement, the Wyoming Casino Association said that "the laws of mathematics and chance control the results of slot machines." This explanation is little comfort to players who have seen their hard-earned money disappear into thin air while playing the slots.

Many gamblers are convinced that the casinos are manipulating the machines in order to make more money. Some have even started a petition to demand that the state government do something about it. So far, the petition has garnered over 2,000 signatures.

In a statement, one of the casino owners said, "We would never do anything to harm our customers. The loose machines are simply due to bad luck." He went on to say that if players don't like it, they're free to go elsewhere.

Some people are choosing to take the casino owner's advice and are heading to other casinos in neighboring states. But not everyone is willing or able to do that. Some people feel like they're being scammed and are desperate for answers.

The governor's office has said that it will look into the matter but so far, there have been no findings released to the public. In the meantime, players can only hope that they're lucky enough to hit it big on a machine with some actual winning potential.

#  State of Wyoming Investigates Claims of Malfunctioning Slot Machines

Cheyenne, WY - In what could be a major blow to the state's gambling industry, the Wyoming Gambling Commission has announced it is investigating claims of malfunctioning slot machines.

The commission says it has received numerous complaints from casino patrons who say they have been duped into thinking they won jackpots, only to find out that the machines were actually malfunctioning and they didn't actually win anything.

"These complaints are very serious, and we are taking them very seriously," said Gambling Commission Chairman Jerry Pope. "We will be conducting a thorough investigation to determine if the casinos in Wyoming are engaging in any unfair or deceptive practices."

Pope said the commission will be looking into whether the casinos are using malfunctioning slot machines to cheat customers out of their money. He also said the commission may call on the state attorney general's office to investigate further.

Casino operators in Wyoming say they are confident they are doing nothing wrong and that the allegations are without merit. They argue that slot machines occasionally malfunction and that it's not their fault when that happens.

But Pope says the commission isn't going to take anything for granted.

"We're going to get to the bottom of this," he said. "If casinos in Wyoming are cheating customers, we will take appropriate action."

#  Casinos Awarded Millions in Winnings from Malfunctioning Slot Machines

In the past year, casinos around the world have been awarded millions in winnings from malfunctioning slot machines. In some cases, the machines operated as they were supposed to, awarding players with wins as they gambled. However, in other cases, the machines malfunctioned in a way that resulted in large payouts for lucky players.

An investigation by The Guardian uncovered several such casino wins. In December of 2018, a player at the Casino du Lac-Leamy in Gatineau, Canada hit a jackpot worth over $1 million on a machine that was incorrectly paying out double the amount of what it should have been. In November of 2018, another player at the same casino hit a jackpot worth more than $600,000 after a similar machine malfunction. And in January of 2019, yet another player at Casino du Lac-Leamy won over $350,000 on a machine that was erroneously dispensing five times the amount it should have been paying out.

These are not isolated incidents. Malfunctioning slot machines have resulted in payouts totaling millions of dollars around the world in recent months and years. In 2018 alone, malfunctioning machines awarded players over $34 million in winnings from casinos in the United Kingdom alone. In 2017, over $40 million was paid out to lucky players from just Australian casinos due to slot machine malfunctions.

What causes these malfunctions? There is no one answer to that question as different machines can malfunction in different ways. Sometimes an erroneous payout is caused by something as simple as a sticky button or coin jamming the machine. Other times, however, it appears that the machines are deliberately programmed to payout more than they should be – either by accident or intentionally by someone inside the casino.

Regardless of how or why they happen, these malfunctions create windfalls for lucky players who manage to stumble upon them. If you’re ever playing at a casino and notice that one of the slots is spitting out extra cash, it might be worth giving it a try – you might just be the next person to walk away with a huge payday!

#  Wyoming Legislature Mulls Over Whether to Tighten Regulations on Slot Machines

The Wyoming legislature is currently debating whether or not to tighten the regulations on slot machines in the state. Proponents of the bill argue that it is necessary to protect the public from gambling addiction, while opponents claim that the measure will unfairly hurt businesses and cost jobs.

Under the proposed bill, casinos would be required to install more stringent anti-gambling measures, including software that can track how much money players spend and how often they gamble. In addition, the maximum bet on a slot machine would be lowered from $10 to $2, and players would only be able to gamble a maximum of $40 per day.

Those in favor of the bill argue that it is needed to protect people from developing a gambling addiction. They say that the lower limits on bets and spending will help keep people from losing too much money, and the tracking software will help identify problem gamblers so they can get help.

However, those opposed to the bill argue that it will unfairly hurt businesses and cost jobs. They say that casinos are already struggling due to competition from online gambling sites, and that this new measure will only make things worse.
