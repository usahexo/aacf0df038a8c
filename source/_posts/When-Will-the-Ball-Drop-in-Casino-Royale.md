#  When Will the Ball Drop in Casino Royale?

Casino Royale is set in the early 2000s—specifically, on Nov. 17, 2004. This means that the events of the film take place nearly 14 years ago. So, when will the ball actually drop in Casino Royale?

Since the film is set in the early 2000s, it's likely that the ball would have dropped at midnight on New Year's Eve. This would have put the ball drop at around 1 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2005. However, this is just an approximation; it's possible that the filmmakers took some liberties with the timeline in order to create a more suspenseful story.

Interestingly, since Casino Royale is set in 2004, it takes place before the events of 2008's Quantum of Solace. This means that there are potentially many different ways that the story could continue, depending on how Daniel Craig's Bond decides to move forward from his confrontation with Mathis at the end of Casino Royale.

Regardless of how things play out in future films, it's clear that Casino Royale ended with some pretty major changes for James Bond. He went from being a ruthless assassin to a man who is willing to question his own motivations and make tough choices in order to protect those he cares about. In this way, Casino Royale may be one of the most important entries in the entire Bond series.
