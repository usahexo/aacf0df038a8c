#  Learning How To Play Five Card Draw Poker

If you are looking for a great game to play for fun and for profit, you should consider learning how to play five card draw poker. This game is easy to learn, but can be challenging to master.

The basic premise of the game is that each player is dealt five cards, and then they take turns drawing and discarding cards in order to try to make the best possible poker hand. The player who winds up with the best hand at the end of the game wins.

To win at five card draw poker, you need to be able to make the best possible hands using the five cards that you are dealt. In order of rank, the hands are as follows: royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair, and one pair.

If you want to improve your chances of winning at five card draw poker, there are a few tips that you can keep in mind. First of all, remember that the best possible hand is a royal flush. If you can make any type of royal flush, you will likely win the hand. Furthermore, try to avoid any hands that are not particularly strong. For example, if you are dealt two pair or three of a kind, it is usually better to discard those cards and draw new ones instead of trying to build on those hands.

In addition to keeping these tips in mind, it is also important to be aware of the odds associated with each type of hand. The table below shows some common five card draw poker hands along with their odds:
