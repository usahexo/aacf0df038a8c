#  Rousey Falls at Last Minute in Vegas; Sports Bettors Lose Big 

Saturday night in the world of sports was one to forget for many bettors. The heavily favored Ronda Rousey was thoroughly beaten by Holly Holm in a stunning upset, costing many people dearly.

Rousey was a massive favorite going into the fight, with the odds sitting at -850 at most sports books. That meant a successful $850 bet would have netted just $100 in winnings. With so much money riding on her, Rousey's loss came as a heavy blow to many gamblers. 

To make things worse, Holm was available at much longer odds (+550), meaning those who put money on her won big payouts. In all, it's estimated that sports bettors lost over $20 million on Saturday night as a result of these two fights. 

While there were other marquee matchups on the card - including Conor McGregor vs Jose Aldo and Chris Weidman vs Luke Rockhold - none had quite the same financial implications as Rousey-Holm. 

That said, there were still some big winners on Saturday night. MGM Resorts International, which owns nine Las Vegas casinos, took in over $10 million in betting receipts on the fights. This will no doubt help to offset some of the losses suffered by sports gamblers elsewhere. 

In the end, it was a disappointing night all around for those who put their money on the line. But at least one group came out ahead - and they'll be sure to enjoy their winnings while everyone else tries to forget about what happened in Las Vegas this past weekend.

#  Las Vegas Sports Books Survive Rousey Loss, But Barely 

When UFC fighter Ronda Rousey lost to Holly Holm in November, 2015, the sports books in Las Vegas were not happy. Rousey had been heavily favored to win, and when she lost, the sports books took a beating.

According to ESPN, the Las Vegas sports books lost more than $10 million on that fight. In fact, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported that the statewide betting total on the Rousey-Holm fight was about $72 million, with nearly 90 percent of that money wagered on Rousey.

Rousey's stunning loss was a major upset, and it cost the casinos dearly. However, even though they took a major hit on that fight, the sports books in Las Vegas have managed to stay in business.

There have been some other close calls for the casinos in recent years. In 2014, for example, the Kansas City Royals came from behind to beat the San Francisco Giants in Game 7 of the World Series. That game cost the casinos more than $11 million.

So why have the Las Vegas sports books been able to survive these big losses? The simple answer is that they have been making money on other games. In fact, over the past 10 years or so, the sports books have actually turned a profit overall.

One reason for this is that bettors tend to make mistakes. They often bet based on their emotions rather than on careful analysis of the facts. And when a team like Rousey's loses unexpectedly, it can cause bettors to lose a lot of money very quickly.

The bottom line is that while the losses suffered by the casinos on games like Rousey-Holm are significant, they are usually able to make up for them by winning on other bets. The Las Vegas sports books may not be as profitable as they once were, but they are still alive and kicking

#  UFC 207: How Did the Sports Betting Go in Vegas? 

UFC 207 is now in the books and we now know who the new UFC Welterweight Champion is. As with any major sporting event, there was plenty of betting action leading up to it and in this article we will take a look at how it all went down from a Vegas betting perspective.

First, let's take a look at the odds for the main event matchup between Amanda Nunes and Ronda Rousey. As many people expected, Nunes was a huge betting favorite and she closed as a -650 favorite at most sportsbooks. Rousey, on the other hand, opened as a +425 underdog but her odds quickly climbed to +600 or higher as money poured in on her. In the end, Nunes won by TKO in just 48 seconds so those who backed her cashed in nicely.

The co-main event between Cody Garbrandt and Dominick Cruz also drew plenty of interest from bettors. Garbrandt was a big favorite heading into the fight and he closed as high as -600 at some sportsbooks. He ended up winning by unanimous decision, however, so anyone who bet on him lost their money. As for Cruz, he started out as a +350 underdog but his odds gradually climbed to +500 or higher. He put up a good fight but ultimately came up short so anyone who backed him also lost their money.

There were some other big favorites who managed to win their fights on Friday night. For example, Tarec Saffiedine opened as a -220 favorite and he won by unanimous decision. Johny Hendricks was also a heavy favorite and he won by unanimous decision over Neil Magny. And finally, TJ Dillashaw entered his bout against John Lineker as a sizable -210 favorite and he cruised to a unanimous decision victory.

So overall it was a decent night for the favorites but there were also some disappointments for those who gambled on them. With that said, let's now take a look ahead to UFC 208 which takes place next weekend in Brooklyn!

#  Ronda Rousey Letou: A Flop in the Ring and on the Sports Books 

Ronda Rousey is a fighter best known for being the first woman to win a UFC championship. She was undefeated for a long time and many considered her unbeatable. However, in November 2015 she suffered her first defeat, to Holly Holm. This was followed by another loss in December 2016 to Amanda Nunes.

Rousey’s fall from grace has not been limited to the ring. Her losses have also cost her on the sports books. For example, before her first defeat, she was a 9/1 favorite to beat Holly Holm. After that loss, her odds plummeted to 3/1. And after her second loss, Amanda Nunes became an overwhelming 1/10 favorite against Rousey.

These defeats have caused Rousey’s popularity to plummet as well. In 2015 she was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine. However, in the two years since her first loss she has not been included on the list.

It will be interesting to see if Rousey can make a comeback and regain her former glory.

#  UFC 207 Results: The Sports Betting Edition

UFC 207 is in the books and it didn't disappoint! Amanda Nunes successfully defended her bantamweight title against Ronda Rousey via TKO in just 48 seconds. In the co-main event, Cody Garbrandt upset Dominick Cruz to become the new bantamweight champion.

The early UFC 207 results had a lot of people cashing in on underdog bets. Cody Garbrandt was a +550 underdog against Dominick Cruz, and many people took advantage of that line. Michael Bisping was also a big underdog against Georges St-Pierre, going off at +325. There were also a lot of people who bet on T.J. Dillashaw to win his rematch against John Lineker. Dillashaw was a slight favorite, but the line moved significantly after he missed weight by two pounds.

With Amanda Nunes defeating Ronda Rousey in just 48 seconds, there were undoubtedly some people who lost money on that fight. Rousey was a -2500 favorite and Nunes was a +1100 underdog. The odds were even more lopsided for the other two main card fights.

Overall, the UFC 207 results went pretty much as expected, with only one major upset happening in the co-main event. That said, there were some good betting opportunities for those who did their homework and got paid off handsomely as a result!
