#  Vegas Casino Makes $5M in One Day from Keno Jackpot Game 

Casinos have been around for centuries, and one of the main reasons people visit them is for the hope of winning big jackpots. In fact, it’s not unheard of for casinos to make millions in a single day from jackpot games.

This was certainly the case at one casino in Las Vegas this past October, when they raked in a whopping $5 million from their keno jackpot game. This massive sum was split among a handful of lucky winners, each of whom walked away with over $1 million.

Keno is a game that’s very similar to slots, but players choose numbers instead of symbols. The game is then played out like a Bingo game, with players matching their chosen numbers to those that are drawn. The more numbers you match, the bigger your prize.

Of course, with such big prizes on offer, it’s no wonder that casino players are drawn to keno like moths to a flame. In fact, many people consider keno to be one of the most exciting games available in a casino setting.

So if you ever find yourself in Las Vegas – or any other casino town for that matter – be sure to check out the keno games. Who knows? You might just be the next big winner!

If you are looking for some excitement while in Las Vegas, a trip to the casino might be just what you need. While there, you may want to try your luck at the keno table – and if Lady Luck is on your side, you could win the big one.

Earlier this week, a lucky player hit the $1 million jackpot at the Bellagio casino on the Las Vegas strip. This is the largest keno payout ever recorded in Nevada. The 37-year-old from Los Angeles was playing a game that cost $10 per ticket when she hit the winning numbers. She plans to use her winnings to pay off her mortgage and debts and to take a vacation with her family.

Keno is a lottery-style game that can be played with anywhere from one to 10 picking spots per game. In order to win, players must match as many numbers as possible on their tickets with those drawn from a rotating drum of 80 numbers. The more spots that are played, the higher the potential payout – but the odds of winning also increase.

The Bellagio casino payout isn't the only big one that has been hit recently – earlier this year, an Arizona man won over $2 million on a keno ticket he bought at a tribal casino near Phoenix. So if you're feeling lucky, why not give keno a try while in Las Vegas? With payouts like these, it could be well worth your time!
