#  Cardinals Defeat Panthers in Overtime Thriller

The Cardinals hosted the Panthers in a Week 6 matchup that would go down to the wire. The first half saw the defenses dominate, with both teams failing to score a touchdown. In the third quarter, Carolina finally got on the board with a field goal, but Arizona answered back with one of their own to make it 3-3. In the fourth quarter, things started to heat up. With just over two minutes left in regulation, Cam Newton threw a touchdown pass to make it 10-6 Panthers. The Cardinals drove downfield and scored a touchdown with 34 seconds left on the clock to send the game into overtime. In overtime, Arizona's Chandler Catanzaro kicked the game-winning field goal to give them the 13-10 victory.

#  Beckham Jr. Shines as Giants Overcome Redskins

Eli Manning looked sharp in the pocket, completing nearly 78 percent of his passes for 353 yards and three touchdowns. However, it was Beckham Jr. who stole the show, catching nine passes for 142 yards and two touchdowns.

The Giants got off to a hot start, scoring on their opening drive to take a 7-0 lead. They would add to their lead later in the first quarter, as Manning found Beckham Jr. for a four-yard touchdown pass. The Redskins would answer back with a field goal before halftime to make it 14-3 in favor of the Giants.

In the third quarter, things would get interesting. The Redskins would score two touchdowns to take a 17-14 lead, but Beckham Jr. would respond with his own pair of touchdowns to give the Giants a 28-17 advantage. They would hold on for the win, with Manning expertly leading them downfield in the closing minutes.

This was an important win for the Giants, as they had lost their previous two games heading into Sunday's matchup. Beckham Jr., in particular, was impressive, showing that he is one of the best wide receivers in the league. If he can continue playing at this level, the Giants should be able to make a playoff run this season.

#  Brees Leads Saints to Victory Over Falcons

Drew Brees threw for 396 yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winner to Michael Thomas with 1:25 remaining, as the New Orleans Saints rallied to defeat the Atlanta Falcons 43-37 on Sunday afternoon at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

 Alvin Kamara had 15 carries for 124 yards and two touchdowns, and Thomas caught nine passes for 117 yards for the Saints (4-1), who have won four in a row after opening the season with a loss to Tampa Bay.

Matt Ryan completed 27 of 45 passes for 331 yards and four touchdowns for Atlanta (3-2), which has lost two in a row. Julio Jones had 10 receptions for 169 yards and two touchdowns, and Calvin Ridley also caught two touchdown passes.

#  Elliott Scores Two Touchdowns as Cowboys Top Buccaneers

The Dallas Cowboys (3-3) cruised to a 28-14 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-4) on Sunday afternoon. Backup quarterback Dak Prescott threw for two touchdowns and running back Ezekiel Elliott rushed for 121 yards and another score as the Cowboys notched their third win of the season.

The Buccaneers received the opening kickoff but were forced to punt after three plays. The Cowboys then went on an 11-play, 75-yard touchdown drive, capped off by a six-yard scoring pass from Prescott to wide receiver Terrance Williams. Elliott carried the ball eight times for 47 yards on the drive, including a 26-yard scamper that set up the score.

Tampa Bay responded with a nine-play touchdown drive of its own, with quarterback Jameis Winston finding wide receiver Mike Evans for a four-yard touchdown pass. The Cowboys quickly regained the lead, though, as Prescott found tight end Jason Witten for a 10-yard touchdown pass early in the second quarter.

Elliott added his second touchdown of the day midway through the second quarter, running in from five yards out to give Dallas a 21-7 lead. The Buccaneers pulled within 21-14 late in the half but could get no closer, and Dallas led at halftime 21-14.

The Cowboys added another touchdown in the third quarter, with Prescott finding wide receiver Cole Beasley for a six-yard score. Tampa Bay managed just one more score, with Winston hitting Evans again late in the fourth quarter. But it was too little too late as Dallas held on for the 28-14 victory.

#  Carr and Raiders Thump Jets in Primetime

It was a dominant performance by the Raiders on Monday night, as they cruised to a 34-20 victory over the Jets. Derek Carr had an efficient night, throwing for 287 yards and three touchdowns. Latavius Murray also had a huge game, rushing for 119 yards and two touchdowns. The defense was relentless all night, recording four sacks and forcing four turnovers.

This was a big win for the Raiders, who are now in first place in the AFC West. They have a tough schedule ahead, but if they can continue to play this well, they have a chance to make a run at the Super Bowl.

The Jets have been one of the biggest disappointments in the NFL this season. They now have a 4-7 record and are in danger of missing the playoffs. Some changes need to be made if they want to turn things around next year.

The Raiders will host the Bills next week. The Bills have been one of the biggest surprises in the NFL this year, but the Raiders should be able to take care of them at home.
